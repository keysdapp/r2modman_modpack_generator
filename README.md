# r2modman Modpack Generator

A simple python script that turns a profile from [r2modman](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus) (untested on Thunderstore) into a modpack.

Currently the only game this has been tested on is Lethal Company, but to my knowledge it should work for any game. It has also only been tested on Windows, but should work on any platform.

## Usage

You must have [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) downloaded to use this program.

1. Click on Code > Download ZIP
2. Unzip the file.
3. Open the directory in your terminal of choice.
4. Install the requirements.txt in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (highly recommended) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the script using `python main.py`.
6. Everything from there on should be self-explanatory, except how to upload the modpack. For that, refer to [this link](https://h3vr-modding.github.io/wiki/creating/thunderstore/modpacks.html#uploading-your-mod).
